Instructions

- Functions intended to run for each scan
  need to start with `run_`, e.g., `run_slope`.

- Do not modify the parameters of the `run_` function
  unless you know what you are doing.
  See optional parameters at:
  https://github.com/tangible-landscape/grass-tangible-landscape/wiki/Running-analyses-and-developing-workflows#python-workflows

- All gs.run_command/read_command/write_command/parse_command
  need to be passed *env* parameter like this: `(..., env=env)`.
